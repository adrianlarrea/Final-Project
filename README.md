# Final-Project

The project is about determining whether average lifespan can be related with average household income. In other words, does wealth have an impact on life expectancy.

Pearson correlation coefficient will help determine if there is indeed a correlation among those two variables

Then we will use different machine learning models to create a lifespan predictor based on the selected features

Finally we will advice on how to better improve the model and some more digging to better improve the quality of the predictor
